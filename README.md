The purpose of this repository is to explore programming language solving an academic exercise and practice TDD thinking

The first version of airport the controller is a simple FIFO (a flying airplane which has less fuel than others will not have priority)

# Tested environment

##  Cygwin

- unit test

    cd airport-simulator/cpp-solution/test  \
    ./run-build.sh                          \
    cd build                                \
